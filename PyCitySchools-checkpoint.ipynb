    "The school and student data consisted of 15 schools (district and charter) and approximately 39,000 students.  When looking at math versus reading scores, a higher percentage of students passed reading.  \n",
    "For charter schools, 93% of students passed math, and 96% of students passed reading.  For district schools, 67% passed math while 81% passed reading.  While 90% of charter students passed both math and reading, only 54% of district students passed both.\n",
    "Overall, charter schools had a lower volume of students, per student budget and overall budget; however, they had a higher average math and reading score, as well as passing math and reading percentage.  The top 5 highest performing schools were charter schools, and the top 5 bottom performing schools were district schools.  Based on the data, we can conclude charter school students outperform district schools on math and reading testing from a percentage of student perspective, and this is primarily due to the smaller volume of students.  \n",
